/**
 * <p>
 * Specifies that a bean is application scoped.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * While <tt>ApplicationScoped</tt> must be associated with the built-in application context required by the specification,
 * third-party extensions are
 * allowed to also associate it with their own context. Behavior described below is only related to the built-in application context.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The application scope is active:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>during the <tt>service()</tt> method of any servlet in the web application, during the <tt>doFilter()</tt> method of any
 * servlet filter and when the container calls any <tt>ServletContextListener</tt>, <tt>HttpSessionListener</tt>,
 * <tt>AsyncListener</tt> or <tt>ServletRequestListener</tt>,</li>
 * <li>during any Java EE web service invocation,</li>
 * <li>during any remote method invocation of any EJB, during any asynchronous method invocation of any EJB, during any call to
 * an EJB timeout method and during message delivery to any EJB message-driven bean,</li>
 * <li>when the disposer method or <tt>@PreDestroy</tt> callback of any bean with any normal scope other than
 * <tt>@ApplicationScoped</tt> is called, and</li>
 * <li>during <tt>@PostConstruct</tt> callback of any bean.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The application context is shared between all servlet requests, web service invocations, EJB remote method invocations, EJB
 * asynchronous method invocations, EJB timeouts and message deliveries to message-driven beans that execute within the same
 * application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The application context is destroyed when the application is shut down.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
  * An event with qualifier <tt>@Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class)</tt> is fired when the application context is initialized
  * and an event with qualifier <tt>@Destroyed(ApplicationScoped.class)</tt> when the application context is destroyed.
  * The event payload is:
  * </p>
  *
  * <ul>
  * <li>the <tt>ServletContext</tt> if the application is a web application deployed to a Servlet container, or</li>
  * <li>any <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> for other types of application.</li>
  * </ul>
