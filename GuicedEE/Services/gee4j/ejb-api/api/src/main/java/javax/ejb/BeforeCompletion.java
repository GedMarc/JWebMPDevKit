/**
 * Designate a stateful session bean method to receive the before completion
 * session synchronization callback.
 * <p>
 *
 * The before completion callback notifies a stateful session bean
 * instance that a transaction is about to be committed.
 * <p>
 *  This method executes in the proper transaction context.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The instance may still cause the container to
 * rollback the transaction by invoking the <code>setRollbackOnly()</code> method
 * on the session context or by throwing an exception.
 *
 * A bean must have at most one <code>BeforeCompletion</code> method.  
 * The signature of this method must observe the following rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The method must not be declared as <code>final</code> or <code>static</code>.
 * <li> The method may have any access type.
 * <li> The return type must be <code>void</code>.
 * <li> The method must take no arguments.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *  A stateful session bean class may use either the
 *  <code>SessionSynchronization</code> interface or the session
 *  synchronization annotations, but not both.
 *
 * @see SessionSynchronization
 * @see AfterBegin
 * @see AfterCompletion
