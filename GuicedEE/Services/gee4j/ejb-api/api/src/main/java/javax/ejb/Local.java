/**
 * Declares the local business interface(s) for a session bean.

 * business interface to designate a local interface of the bean.

 * When used on the bean class, declares the local business interface(s) 
 * for a session bean.  When used on an interface, designates that interface
 * as a local business interface.  In this case, no <code>value</code> element

 * The <code>Local</code> annotation applies only to session beans and

 * exposes one or more local business interface and any of the following is true:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the bean class does not implement its business interfaces
 * <li>the bean exposes a no-interface view
 * <li>the bean class implements more than one interface and at least one of the interfaces
