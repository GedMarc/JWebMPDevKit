/**
 * Declares the remote home interface or adapted remote home interface
 * for a session bean.  The value is never a 2.x remote component interface.
 * <p>
 * Clients written to the enterprise bean 2.1 and earlier client view depend upon the 
 * existence of a home and component interface.
 * A session bean written to the enterprise bean 3.x API may be adapted to such earlier 
 * preexisting client view interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The session bean designates the home interface to be adapted by using 
 * the <code>RemoteHome</code> annotation on the bean class.  The corresponding 
 * remote component interface need not be explicitly specified, as it is
 * derived from the return type of remote home interface's
 * create method signature.
 * <p>
 * Session beans written to the EJB 3.0 and later APIs do not otherwise make
 * use of remote home interfaces.
