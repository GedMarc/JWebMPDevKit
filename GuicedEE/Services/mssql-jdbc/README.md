# Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server

Welcome to the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server project!

The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs) available in the Java Platform, Enterprise Editions. The Driver provides access to Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database from any Java application, application server, or Java-enabled applet.

We hope you enjoy using the Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server.

## Announcements
What's coming next?  We will look into adding a more comprehensive set of tests, improving our javadocs, and start developing the next set of features.

## Get Started 
* [**Ubuntu + SQL Server + Java**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/java/ubuntu) 
* [**Red Hat + SQL Server + Java**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/java/rhel)

* [**Windows + SQL Server + Java**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/java/windows)

## Build
### Prerequisites
* Java 11
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* An instance of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database that you can connect to. 

### Build the JAR files
Maven builds automatically trigger a set of verification tests to run.  For these tests to pass, you will first need to add an environment variable in your system called `mssql_jdbc_test_connection_properties` to provide the [correct connection properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/building-the-connection-url) for your SQL Server or Azure SQL Database instance.

To build the jar files, you must use Java 11 with Maven. You can choose to build a JDBC 4.3 compliant jar file (for use with JRE 11) and/or a JDBC 4.2 compliant jar file (for use with JRE 8).

* Maven:
	1. If you have not already done so, add the environment variable `mssql_jdbc_test_connection_properties` in your system with the connection properties for your SQL Server or SQL DB instance.
	2. Run one of the commands below to build a JDBC 4.3 compliant jar or JDBC 4.2 compliant jar in the `\target` directory. 
    	* Run `mvn install -Pbuild43`. This creates JDBC 4.3 compliant jar in `\target` directory
    	* Run `mvn install -Pbuild42`. This creates JDBC 4.2 compliant jar in `\target` directory

* Gradle:
	1. If you have not already done so, add the environment variable `mssql_jdbc_test_connection_properties` in your system with the connection properties for your SQL Server or SQL DB instance.
	2. Run one of the commands below to build a JDBC 4.3 compliant jar or JDBC 4.2 compliant jar in the `\build\libs` directory. 
    	* Run `gradle build -PbuildProfile=build43`. This creates JDBC 4.3 compliant jar in `\build\libs` directory
    	* Run `gradle build -PbuildProfile=build42`. This creates JDBC 4.2 compliant jar in `\build\libs` directory

## Resources

### Documentation
API reference documentation is available in [Javadocs](https://aka.ms/jdbcjavadocs).

This driver is documented on [Microsoft's Documentation web site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/getting-started-with-the-jdbc-driver).

### Sample Code
For samples, please see the `src\sample` directory.

### Download the DLLs
For some features (e.g. Integrated Authentication and Distributed Transactions), you may need to use the `sqljdbc_xa` and `sqljdbc_auth` DLLs. They can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=868287)

### Download the driver
Don't want to compile anything?

We're now on the Maven Central Repository. Add the following to your POM file to get the most stable release:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
	<artifactId>mssql-jdbc</artifactId>
	<version>7.2.2.jre11</version><type>jar</type>
            </dependency>
```
The driver can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=868287).

To get the latest preview version of the driver, add the following to your POM file: 

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
	<artifactId>mssql-jdbc</artifactId>
	<version>7.3.0.jre11-preview</version><type>jar</type>
            </dependency>
```

### Using driver as Java Module
Starting from version 7.0.0, the driver Jars (jre10 and above) will expose 'Automatic-Module' as **'com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc'**. The supporting Jar can now be added to ModulePath to access this module.

mvn dependency:tree
```

### Azure Key Vault and Azure Active Directory Authentication Dependencies
Projects that require either of the two features need to explicitly declare the dependency in their pom file.

***For Example:*** If you are using *Azure Active Directory Authentication feature* then you need to redeclare *adal4j* and *client-runtime* dependency in your project's pom file. Please see the following snippet: 

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
	<artifactId>mssql-jdbc</artifactId>
	<version>7.3.0.jre11-preview</version>
	<scope>compile</scope><type>jar</type>
            </dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
	<artifactId>adal4j</artifactId>
	<version>1.6.3</version><type>jar</type>
            </dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.rest</groupId>
	<artifactId>client-runtime</artifactId>
	<version>1.6.5</version><type>jar</type>
            </dependency>
```

***For Example:*** If you are using *Azure Key Vault feature* then you need to redeclare *azure-keyvault*, *azure-keyvault-webkey* dependency and *adal4j*, *client-runtime* dependency in your project's pom file. Please see the following snippet: 

```xml

## Guidelines for Reporting Issues
We appreciate you taking the time to test the driver, provide feedback and report any issues. It would be extremely helpful if you:

- Report each issue as a new issue (but check first if it's already been reported)
- Try to be detailed in your report. Useful information for good bug reports include:
  * What you are seeing and what the expected behaviour is
  * Which jar file?
  * Environment details: e.g. Java version, client operating system?
  * Table schema (for some issues the data types make a big difference!)
  * Any other relevant information you want to share
- Try to include a Java sample demonstrating the isolated problem.

Thank you!

### Reporting security issues and security bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).

## Release roadmap and standards
Our goal is to release regular updates which improve the driver and bring new features to users. Stable, production quality releases happen twice a year, targeting the first and third quarters of the calendar year. They are tested against a comprehensive matrix of supported operating systems, Java versions, and SQL Server versions. Stable releases are accompanied by additional localized packages, which are available on the Microsoft website.

Preview releases happen approximately monthly between stable releases. This gives users an opportunity to try out new features and provide feedback on them before they go into stable releases. Preview releases also include frequent bug fixes for customers to verify without having to wait for a stable release. Preview releases are only available in English. While they are tested, preview releases do not necessarily go through the same rigorous, full test matrix and review process as stable releases.

You can see what is going into a future release by monitoring [Milestones](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-jdbc/milestones) in the repository.

### Versioning convention
Starting with 6.0, stable versions have an even minor version. For example, 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 7.0, 7.2. Preview versions have an odd minor version. For example, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 7.1.
