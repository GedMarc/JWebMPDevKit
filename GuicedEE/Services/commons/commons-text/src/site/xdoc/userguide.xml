    <section name="Description">
      <p>The Commons Text library provides additions to the standard JDK's
        text handling. Our goal is to provide a consistent set of tools for
        processing text generally from computing distances between Strings
        to being able to efficiently do String escaping of various types.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="text.*">

      <p>Originally the text package was added in Commons Lang 2.2. However, its
        new home is here. It provides, amongst other
        classes, a replacement for <code>StringBuffer</code> named <code>
          StrBuilder</code>, a class for substituting variables within a String
        named <code>StrSubstitutor</code> and a replacement for StringTokenizer
        named <code>StrTokenizer</code>. While somewhat ungainly, the <code>
          Str
        </code> prefix has been used to ensure we don't clash with any current
        or future standard Java classes.
      </p>

      <p>Beyond the text utilities ported over from lang, we have also included various
        string similarity and distance functions. Lastly, there are also utilities for
        addressing differences between bodies of text for the sake of viewing these
        differences.
      </p>

      <subsection name="StringEscapeUtils">
        <p>From Lang 3.5, we have moved into Text StringEscapeUtils and StrTokenizer.
          It's provides ways in which to generate pieces of text, such as might
          be used for default passwords. StringEscapeUtils contains methods to
          escape and unescape Java, JavaScript, HTML and XML. It is worth noting that
          the package <code>org.apache.commons.text.translate</code> holds the
          functionality underpinning the StringEscapeUtils with mappings and translations
          between such mappings for the sake of doing String escaping. StrTokenizer is
          an improved alternative to java.util.StringTokenizer.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Similarity and Distance">
        <p>The <code>org.apache.commons.text.similarity</code> packages contains various different mechanisms of
          calculating "similarity scores" as well as "edit distances between Strings. Note,
          the difference between a "similarity score" and a "distance function" is that
          a distance functions meets the following qualifications:
          <ul>
            <li><code>d(x,y) &gt;= 0</code>, non-negativity or separation axiom
            </li>
            <li><code>d(x,y) == 0</code>, if and only if,
              <code>x == y</code>
            </li>
            <li><code>d(x,y) == d(y,x)</code>, symmetry, and
            </li>
            <li><code>d(x,z) &lt;= d(x,y) + d(y,z)</code>, the triangle inequality
            </li>
          </ul>
          whereas a "similarity score" need not satisfy all such properties. Though, it
          is fairly easy to "normalize" a similarity score to manufacture an "edit distance."
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of "edit distances" that we currently support follow:
          <ul>
            <li>Cosine Distance,</li>
            <li>Hamming Distance,</li>
            <li>Jaccard Distance,</li>
            <li>Jaro Winkler Distance,</li>
            <li>Levenshtein Distance,</li>
            <li>Longest Commons Subsequence Distance,</li>
          </ul>
          and the list of "similarity scores" that we support follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Cosine Similarity,</li>
            <li>Fuzzy Score Similarity,</li>
            <li>Jaccard Similarity, and</li>
            <li>Longest Common Subsequence Similarity.</li>
          </ul>

              name="Text diff'ing">
        <p>The <code>org.apache.commons.text.diff</code> package contains code for
          doing diff between strings. The initial implementation of the Myers algorithm was adapted from the
          commons-collections sequence package.

      <p>Provides algorithms for string similarity.</p>

      <p>The algorithms that implement the EditDistance interface follow the
        same
        simple principle: the more similar (closer) strings are, lower is the
        distance.
        For example, the words house and hose are closer than house and
        trousers.
      </p>

      <p>The following algorithms are available at the moment:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>CosineDistance</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>CosineSimilarity</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>FuzzyScore</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>HammingDistance</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>JaroWinklerDistance</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LevenshteinDistance</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>LongestCommonSubsequenceDistance</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <code>CosineDistance</code> utilises a
        <code>RegexTokenizer</code>
        regular expression tokenizer (\w+). And the <code>
          LevenshteinDistance</code>'s
        behaviour can be changed to take into consideration a maximum
        throughput.
