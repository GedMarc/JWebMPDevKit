	 * In environments where the JVM will never shut down while reinstalling UADetector, it is necessary to manually
	 * shutdown running threads of <code>UserAgentStringParser</code>s with <b>updating functionality</b> like
	 * <code>UADetectorServiceFactory.getCachingAndUpdatingParser()</code> or
	 * <code>UADetectorServiceFactory.getOnlineUpdatingParser()</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * For example, if a web application with UADetector will be re-deployed within an <i>Apache Tomcat</i> you must
	 * shutdown your self-created or via <code>UADetectorServiceFactory</code> retrieved updating
	 * <code>UserAgentStringParser</code> otherwise more and more threads will be registered.
	 * <p>
	 * An implementation of <code>UserAgentStringParser</code> has <b>updating functionality</b> if it works with a
	 * {@link net.sf.uadetector.datastore.RefreshableDataStore}.
	 * <p>
	 * If you call shutdown on a non-updating <code>UserAgentStringParser</code> implementation nothing will happen.
	 * <p>
	 * A number of Dependency Injection containers support the annotation  PreDestroy which is be useful for
	 * indicating methods that should be called when the container is shutting down. This annotation is available by
	 * default in Java SE 7 and can be made available through the external library <i>jsr250-api-1.0.jar</i> for earlier
	 * versions of Java.
	 * <p>
	 * We recommend to annotate an implementation of {@link #shutdown()} with PreDestroy to inform a container
	 * (for example <i>Spring Framework</i>) to trigger the shutdown method automatically by convention during the
	 * shutdown lifecycle. This saves developers to call explicitly the shutdown method.
	 * <p>
	 * To shutdown all managed {@code ExecutorService} by UADetector at once, you can call also
	 * {@link net.sf.uadetector.internal.util.ExecutorServices#shutdownAll()}.
