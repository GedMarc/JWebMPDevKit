/**
 * Defines a version number of an operating system or user agent.<br>
 * <br>
 * Generally, a version number represents unique states of a software. Version numbers are different versions of a
 * single software in order to distinguish different versions of development cycles.<br>
 * <br>
 * A classic version number is often composed of:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Major release</strong><br>
 * indexes mostly very significant change in the program - for example when the program was completely rewritten or
 * libraries can be maintained at no interface compatibility.</li>
 * <li><strong>Minor release</strong><br>
 * usually referred to a functional extension of a program.</li>
 * <li><strong>Patch level</strong><br>
 * contains mostly bug fixes.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A version number may also contain additions, for example, to document a development stage of a software.<br>
 * <br>
 * The implementation of this interface may be mutable or immutable. This interface only gives access to retrieve data,
 * never to change it.
